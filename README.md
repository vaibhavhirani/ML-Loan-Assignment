# ML-Loan-Assignment

## Predictive loan model for an applicant
### Objective:
Predict the risk of a loan being default based on the past loan data, for a given loan applicant 

### Dataset: 
### https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XCKR-Gdw9yziWWW6TVvx5wvArFkP96PP

## Part 1:
1. Identification of the performance parameters to be improved, for the given problem statement
2. Baseline performance figures for 5 different ML classifiers, after minimal data pre-processing,
Baseline figures must include (i) accuracy (ii) classification report (iii) confusion matrix (iv)
ROC-AUC and AUPRC scores. One of the classifiers must be ANN.
3. Observations from exploratory analysis of the dataset
4. Outline of feature engineering techniques that may be used to improve the classifier
performance

## Part 2:
1. Shortlist 3 best performing classifiers, from Part 1
2. Apply relevant feature engineering techniques on the dataset provided
3. Compare the performance of the 3 classifiers with the baseline performance figured obtained during Part 1
4. Note down the features that figure high in feature ranking

## Part 3:
1. Apply ensemble techniques to observe their impact on the performance of the classifiers
